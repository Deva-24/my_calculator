## Overview

This project is a simple calculator application implemented in Python. It provides basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application is designed using object-oriented principles and incorporates design patterns such as the Factory Method and Strategy Pattern. The code is well-structured, with separate modules for operations, the calculator logic, and base classes for calculations.

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handle division by zero exceptions.
- Maintain a history of calculations.
- Implemented using object-oriented programming.
- Clear and maintainable code with extensive docstrings and type hints.
- Test coverage using `pytest`.
